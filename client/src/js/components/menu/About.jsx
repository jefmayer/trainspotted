    <p>
      Trainspotted is my home office, set up in front of a backyard window looking out at the Milwaukee District North tracks across the alley.
       During off-peak hours, freight trains are cleared to run along the Metra corridor.
       Much like my work situation, the trains don&rsquo;t adhere to any set schedule. This is an exercise in applying structure to the chaos surrounding this new phase of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project also brought me up to speed with React/Redux and was developed using the full MERN stack.
